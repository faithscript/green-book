Q:
A clock (numbered 1 - 12 clockwise) fell off the wall and broke into three pieces. You
find that the sums of the numbers on each piece are equal. What are the numbers on each
piece? (No strange-shaped piece is allowed.)

Solution:

First, calculate the total sum of the numbers 1 to 12:
Sum = 1 + 2 + ... + 12 = (12 Ã— 13) / 2 = 78

If the clock is broken into three pieces with equal sums, each piece must sum to 78 / 3 = 26.

One possible way to split the clock into three contiguous pieces (no strange shapes) is:
- Piece 1: 12, 1, 2, 11 (sum = 12 + 1 + 2 + 11 = 26)
- Piece 2: 3, 10, 4, 9 (sum = 3 + 10 + 4 + 9 = 26)
- Piece 3: 5, 8, 6, 7 (sum = 5 + 8 + 6 + 7 = 26)

Thus, the numbers on each piece are:
- (12, 1, 2, 11)
- (3, 10, 4, 9)
- (5, 8, 6, 7)

Each group is a contiguous arc on the clock face, and all sums are equal to 26.
