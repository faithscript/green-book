You are holding two glass balls in a 100-story building. If a ball is thrown out of the
window, it will not break if the floor number is less than X, and it will always break if
the floor number is equal to or greater than X. You would like to determine X. What is
the strategy that will minimize the number of drops for the worst case scenario? 

Solution:

The optimal strategy is to minimize the maximum number of drops needed in the worst case by using decreasing intervals:

1. Drop the first ball from floor n, then n-1 floors higher, then n-2 higher, and so on. That is, drop from floors: n, n+(n-1), n+(n-1)+(n-2), ..., until you reach or exceed floor 100.
2. When the first ball breaks, use the second ball to check each floor one by one after the previous drop, up to the breaking floor.

To find the minimum n:
- The sum n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 must be at least 100.
- The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2.
- Solve n(n+1)/2 ≥ 100. The smallest integer n is 14 (since 14×15/2 = 105).

So, drop the first ball from floors 14, 27 (14+13), 39 (14+13+12), 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100, etc., decreasing the interval by 1 each time.

Why decrease the interval? By reducing the interval by 1 each time, you ensure that, no matter when the first ball breaks, the total number of drops (first + second ball) is always at most n. This guarantees the minimum number of drops in the worst case.

Thus, the minimum number of drops required in the worst case is 14.
