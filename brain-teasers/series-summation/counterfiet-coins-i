Q:
There are 10 bags with 100 identical coins in each bag. In all bags but one, each coin
weighs 10 grams. However, all the coins in the counterfeit bag weigh either 9 or 1
grams. Can you find the counterfeit bag in only one weighing, using a digital scale that
tells the exact weight?

Solution:

1. Label the bags from 1 to 10.
2. Take a unique number of coins from each bag: 1 coin from Bag 1, 2 coins from Bag 2, ..., up to 10 coins from Bag 10.
3. Weigh all these coins together on the digital scale. The total number of coins is 1+2+...+10 = 55.
4. If all coins were genuine (10 grams each), the total weight would be 55 Ã— 10 = 550 grams.
5. If the counterfeit bag contains 9-gram coins, the total weight will be less than 550 grams. The difference (550 - actual weight) tells you the bag number: difference = number of coins taken from the counterfeit bag.
6. If the counterfeit bag contains 1-gram coins, the difference will be much larger: (550 - actual weight) divided by 9 gives the bag number.

By using this method, you can identify the counterfeit bag in just one weighing.
