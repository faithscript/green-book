Given an arbitrary integer, come up with a rule to decide whether it is divisible by 9 and
prove it.

Thoughts:
digits can be separated into N = d₁ × 10^(n-1) + d₂ × 10^(n-2) + ... + dₙ₋₁ × 10¹ + dₙ × 10⁰
since 10 = 1%9;
10^k  = 1 mod 9 for any k >= 0

so N mod 9 = just the addition of the digits mod 9

so N mod 9 = 0 when the summation of digits can be divided by 9
