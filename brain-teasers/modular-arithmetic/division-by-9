Given an arbitrary integer, come up with a rule to decide whether it is divisible by 9 and
prove it.

Solution:

The Rule: A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

Proof:

Step 1: Express the number in terms of its digits
Let N be an arbitrary integer with digits d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ:
N = d₁ × 10^(n-1) + d₂ × 10^(n-2) + ... + dₙ₋₁ × 10¹ + dₙ × 10⁰

Step 2: Use the key property of 10 modulo 9
Since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9), we have:
10^k ≡ 1^k ≡ 1 (mod 9) for any k ≥ 0

Step 3: Apply this to each term
N ≡ d₁ × 10^(n-1) + d₂ × 10^(n-2) + ... + dₙ × 10⁰ (mod 9)
N ≡ d₁ × 1 + d₂ × 1 + ... + dₙ × 1 (mod 9)
N ≡ d₁ + d₂ + ... + dₙ (mod 9)

Step 4: The divisibility criterion
If N ≡ 0 (mod 9), then d₁ + d₂ + ... + dₙ ≡ 0 (mod 9)
This means the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.

Example: Consider 1233
Sum of digits: 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9
Since 9 is divisible by 9, 1233 is divisible by 9.

The rule works because 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9), so each digit contributes its value to the remainder when divided by 9.
