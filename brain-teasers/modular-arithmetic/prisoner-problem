One hundred prisoners are given the chance to be set free tomorrow. They are all told
that each will be given a red or blue hat to wear. Each prisoner can see everyone else's
hat but not his own. The hat colors are assigned randomly and once the hats are placed
on top of each prisoner's head they cannot communicate with one another in any form, or
else they are immediately executed. The prisoners will be called out in random order and
the prisoner called out will guess the color of his hat. Each prisoner declares the color of
his hat so that everyone else can hear it. If a prisoner guesses correctly the color of his
hat, he is set free immediately; otherwise he is executed.
They are given the night to come up with a strategy among themselves to save as many
prisoners as possible. What is the best strategy they can adopt and how many prisoners
can they guarantee to save?


Thoughts:
The prisoners need to use the first one as a sacrifice to communicate info to everyone else about the overall parity

They need to agree on the parity system, lets say red 1 blue 0

The Chain of Information
The first prisoner establishes the "baseline parity" for everyone.
Each subsequent prisoner then:

Counts the red hats they can see among the remaining prisoners
Remembers what all previous prisoners said
Uses the parity rule to figure out their own hat
