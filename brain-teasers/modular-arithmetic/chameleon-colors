A remote island has three types of chameleons with the following population: 13 red
chameleons, 15 green chameleons and 17 blue chameleons. Each time two chameleons
with different colors meet, they would change their color to the third color. For example,
if a green chameleon meets a red chameleon, they both change their color to blue. Is it
ever possible for all chameleons to become the same color? Why or why not?

Solution:

No, it is impossible for all chameleons to become the same color.

In the chameleon problem, each move (e.g., red + green → 2 blue) corresponds to a vector like (–1, –1, 2), 
and the system evolves by adding integer multiples of such move vectors to the initial vector (17, 15, 13). 
Since all move vectors lie in the plane x + y + z = 45, total chameleon count is preserved.

But there's a deeper invariant:
Each move preserves the differences x − y mod 3 and y − z mod 3.
This is because all move vectors are congruent to (2, 2, 2) mod 3, so the relative differences between colors remain unchanged mod 3.

The initial state has x − y ≡ 2 mod 3, so we can never reach any final state where x − y ≡ 0 mod 3, like (45, 0, 0), (15, 15, 15), or any state where all colors are equal.

Thus, linear algebra and modular arithmetic show it's impossible to reach a uniform color state from (17, 15, 13).
