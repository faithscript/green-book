A remote island has three types of chameleons with the following population: 13 red
chameleons, 15 green chameleons and 17 blue chameleons. Each time two chameleons
with different colors meet, they would change their color to the third color. For example,
if a green chameleon meets a red chameleon, they both change their color to blue. Is it
ever possible for all chameleons to become the same color? Why or why not?

Analysis:
Red: 13, Green: 15, Blue: 17
Total: 45 chameleons

There are 3 cases for meeting
Case 1: Red + Green → Blue + Blue

Red: -1, Green: -1, Blue: +2

Case 2: Red + Blue → Green + Green

Red: -1, Green: +2, Blue: -1

Case 3: Green + Blue → Red + Red

Green: -1, Blue: -1, Red: +2

now lets look at the populations modulo 3 to find an invariantt

(R - G) mod 3 = (13 - 15) mod 3 = (-2) mod 3 = 1
(G - B) mod 3 = (15 - 17) mod 3 = (-2) mod 3 = 1
(B - R) mod 3 = (17 - 13) mod 3 = 4 mod 3 = 1

Let's try and apply some transformations
New (R - G) mod 3 = (R-1) - (G-1) mod 3 = (R - G) mod 3 = 1
New (G - B) mod 3 = (G-1) - (B+2) mod 3 = (G - B - 3) mod 3 = (G - B) mod 3 = 1
New (B - R) mod 3 = (B+2) - (R-1) mod 3 = (B - R + 3) mod 3 = (B - R) mod 3 = 1

so the differences are invariant, and they'll never change no matter how many transformations

we need two populations to be 0, that needs two differences to be 0 mod 3

✓ Possible scenarios:

(12, 15, 18) → all ≡ 0 (mod 3)
(13, 16, 19) → all ≡ 1 (mod 3)
(14, 17, 20) → all ≡ 2 (mod 3), this allows the differences to be 0 mod 3
