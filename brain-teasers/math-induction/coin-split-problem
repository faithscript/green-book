You split 1000 coins into two piles and count the number of coins in each pile. If there
are x coins in pile one and y coins in pile two, you multiple x by y to get xy. Then you
split both piles further, repeat the same counting and multiplication process, and add the
new multiplication results to the original. For example, you split x to x, andx, y to y,
and Â½ , then the sum is xy + x,x + y,%. The same process is repeated until you only
have piles of 1 stone each. What is the final sum? (The final l's are not included in the
sum.) Prove that you always get the same answer no matter how the piles are divided.

ans: prove it for trees using base cases of 2, 3, 4 then you find out that
for n the answer is n(n-1)/2
