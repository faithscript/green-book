Suppose that you are on a one-way circular race track. There are N gas cans randomly
placed on different locations of the track and the total sum of the gas in these cans is
enough for your car to run exactly one circle. Assume that your car has no gas in the gas
tank initially, but you can put your car at any location on the track and you can pick up
the gas cans along the way to fill in your gas tank. Can you always choose a starting
position on the track so that your car can complete the entire circle?

ans:
Imagine using a test car that has enough gas to complete the full circle. Start it at any gas 
can and drive the full loop. At each gas can (including the starting point), record how much gas is in your tank before adding the gas from that can.

After completing the circle, look through your list of recorded gas levels. The gas can where 
the lowest value was recorded (before refueling) is the best place to start if your real car has zero gas in the tank.

Why? Because starting just after that "lowest dip" ensures that from that point forward, your 
gas level never goes negative — all earlier losses have been “paid for,” and you’re climbing back up from the lowest point.
