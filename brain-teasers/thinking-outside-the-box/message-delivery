Q:
You need to communicate with your colleague in Greenwich via a messenger service.
Your documents are sent in a padlock box. Unfortunately the messenger service is not
secure, so anything inside an unlocked box will be lost (including any locks you place
inside the box) during the delivery. The high-security padlocks you and your colleague
each use have only one key which the person placing the lock owns. How can you
securely send a document to your colleague?

Answer:

You can securely send the document using the following process:

1. Place the document in the box and lock it with your own padlock. Send the locked box to your colleague.
2. Your colleague cannot open your lock, but they can add their own padlock to the box (so now the box has two locks). They send the box back to you.
3. You remove your own padlock (leaving only your colleague's lock on the box) and send the box back to your colleague.
4. Now your colleague can unlock their own padlock and retrieve the document.

At no point is the box unlocked while in transit, and neither party ever has access to the other's key. This ensures the document is securely delivered.
