Q:
Eight quants from different banks are getting together for drinks. They are all interested
in knowing the average salary of the group. Nevertheless, being cautious and humble
individuals, everyone prefers not to disclose his or her own salary to the group. Can you
come up with a strategy for the quants to calculate the average salary without knowing
other people's salaries?

Answer Summary:

One quant picks a random number, adds it to their salary, and passes the sum to the next person.
Each quant adds their own salary and passes it on. After the last quant, the sum returns to the first, 
who subtracts the random number. The group then divides the total by 8 to get the average salary, without 
anyone knowing individual salaries.
