Q:
You just had two dice custom-made. Instead of numbers 1 - 6, you place single-digit
numbers on the faces of each dice so that every morning you can arrange the dice in a
way as to make the two front faces show the current day of the month. You must use
both dice (in other words, days 1 - 9 must be shown as 01 - 09), but you can switch the order of the dice 
if you want. What numbers do you have to put on the six faces of each
of the two dice to achieve that?

Answer:

To display all days from 01 to 31, you need to be able to show every two-digit combination from 01 to 31 using the two dice. Each die can show one digit, and you can swap the dice to show both orders.

Key insight: The digit 6 can be used as a 9 by turning the die upside down.

- Die 1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Die 2: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

But to cover all numbers, the standard solution is:
- Die 1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Die 2: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

With 6 doubling as 9, you can display:
- 01 to 09 (using 0 on one die and 1-9 on the other)
- 10 to 19 (using 1 on one die and 0-9 on the other)
- 20 to 29 (using 2 on one die and 0-9 on the other)
- 30, 31 (using 3 on one die and 0, 1 on the other)

Thus, you can display every day of the month from 01 to 31 with these two dice.
