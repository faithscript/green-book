Q:
There is a light bulb inside a room and four switches outside. All switches are currently
at off state and only one switch controls the light bulb. You may turn any number of
switches on or off any number of times you want. How many times do you need to go
into the room to figure out which switch controls the light bulb?

Alternative Solution:

1. Turn on switches 1 and 2.
2. Wait for a while (so the bulb, if controlled by 1 or 2, gets hot).
3. Turn off switch 2 and turn on switch 3.
4. Enter the room quickly and check the bulb:

- If the bulb is **on and hot** → switch 1 controls the light.
- If the bulb is **off and hot** → switch 2 controls the light.
- If the bulb is **on and cold** → switch 3 controls the light.
- If the bulb is **off and cold** → switch 4 controls the light.

This method ensures you can always identify the correct switch with just one visit to the room, using both the state (on/off) and the temperature (hot/cold) of the bulb.
