Q:
A bag has 20 blue balls and 14 red balls. Each time you randomly take two balls out.
(Assume each ball in the bag has equal probability of being taken). You do not put these
two balls back. Instead, if both balls have the same color, you add a blue ball to the bag;
if they have different colors, you add a red ball to the bag. Assume that you have an
unlimited supply of blue and red balls, if you keep on repeating this process, what will
be the color of the last ball left in the bag?' What if the bag has 20 blue balls and 13 red
balls instead?

Answer:

Let's analyze the process:

- If you take two balls of the same color (BB or RR), you remove two and add one blue ball.
- If you take two balls of different colors (BR), you remove both and add one red ball.

Key insight: Every time you remove two balls, the total number of balls decreases by one.

Now, focus on the number of red balls:
- If you pick two reds (RR): you lose two reds, gain one blue (red count decreases by 2).
- If you pick two blues (BB): you lose two blues, gain one blue (red count unchanged).
- If you pick one red and one blue (BR): you lose one red, lose one blue, gain one red (red count unchanged).

So, the only way to change the number of red balls is by picking two reds, which decreases the red count by 2. Otherwise, the parity (odd/even) of the number of red balls never changes.

**Case 1: 14 red balls (even)**
- The parity is even, and every time you remove two reds, it stays even.
- Eventually, you will be left with one blue ball at the end.

**Case 2: 13 red balls (odd)**
- The parity is odd, and it stays odd throughout the process.
- Eventually, you will be left with one red ball at the end.

**Summary:**
- If the initial number of red balls is even, the last ball is blue.
- If the initial number of red balls is odd, the last ball is red.
