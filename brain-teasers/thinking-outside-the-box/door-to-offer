Q:
You are facing two doors. One leads to your job offer and the other leads to exit. In front
of either door is a guard. One guard always tells lies and the other always tells the truth.
You can only ask one guard one yes/no question. Assuming you do want to get the job
offer, what question will you ask?

Decision Tree Explanation:

Ask one guard: "If I asked the other guard which door leads to the offer, would they say this one?"

Decision Tree:

Start
 |
 |-- Ask the question above to either guard
      |
      |-- If the answer is YES:
      |      Do NOT choose this door
      |
      |-- If the answer is NO:
             Choose this door

This works because:
- If you ask the truth-teller, they truthfully report the liar's answer (which would be a lie).
- If you ask the liar, they lie about the truth-teller's answer (which would be the truth).
- In both cases, the answer always points you away from the wrong door and toward the correct one.

Detailed Decision Tree Proof:

Let D1 = Door 1, D2 = Door 2 (one is the offer, one is exit)
Let G1 = Truth-teller, G2 = Liar
Suppose you want to know if D1 is the offer door.

Ask either guard: "If I asked the other guard if D1 is the offer, would they say YES?"

Case 1: D1 is the offer
  - G1 (Truth-teller):
      - G2 (Liar) would say NO (because D1 is the offer, but G2 lies)
      - G1 truthfully reports NO
  - G2 (Liar):
      - G1 (Truth-teller) would say YES (because D1 is the offer)
      - G2 lies and says NO
  => In both cases, the answer is NO if D1 is the offer

Case 2: D1 is NOT the offer
  - G1 (Truth-teller):
      - G2 (Liar) would say YES (because D2 is the offer, but G2 lies)
      - G1 truthfully reports YES
  - G2 (Liar):
      - G1 (Truth-teller) would say NO (because D1 is not the offer)
      - G2 lies and says YES
  => In both cases, the answer is YES if D1 is NOT the offer

Summary:
- If the answer is YES, D1 is NOT the offer (so do not choose it)
- If the answer is NO, D1 IS the offer (so choose it)

This logic works for either door and either guard, so you always find the correct door.
