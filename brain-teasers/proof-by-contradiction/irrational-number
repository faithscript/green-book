Can you prove that sqrt(2) is an irrational number? A rational number is a number that can
be expressed as a ratio of two integers; otherwise it is irrational.

Proof that √2 is irrational (by contradiction):

Assume √2 is rational.

Then we can write √2 = m/n, where m and n are integers with no common factors (simplest form).

Square both sides:
√2 = m/n → 2 = m² / n² → m² = 2n²

So m² is even → m must be even. Let m = 2x.

Substitute into the equation:
(2x)² = 2n² → 4x² = 2n² → n² = 2x²

So n² is also even → n is even.

Now both m and n are even, which contradicts the assumption that m/n was in simplest form (no common factors).

Therefore, √2 is irrational.
