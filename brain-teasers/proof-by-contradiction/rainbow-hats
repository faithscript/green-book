Seven prisoners are given the chance to be set free tomorrow. An executioner will put a
hat on each prisoner's head. Each hat can be one of the seven colors of the rainbow and
the hat colors are assigned completely at the executioner's discretion. Every prisoner can see the hat colors of the other six prisoners, 
but not his own. They cannot communicate
with others in any form, or else they are immediately executed. Then each prisoner
writes down his guess of his own hat color. If at least one prisoner correctly guesses the
color of his hat, they all will be set free immediately; otherwise they will be executed.
They are given the night to come up with a strategy. Is there a strategy that they can
guarantee that they will be set free?

So the trick is to make each prisoner assume a different total sum mod 7.

Prisoner 0 assumes the total sum is 0 mod 7

Prisoner 1 assumes the total sum is 1 mod 7

...

Prisoner 6 assumes the total sum is 6 mod 7

Each one guesses what their hat would have to be if their assumption were true.

And since the real total sum mod 7 has to be one of those 7 values, one of them is definitely assuming correctly, and will guess right.

That one correct guess is enough to save the entire group.
