Q:
You are invited to a welcome party with 25 fellow team members. Each of the fellow
members shakes hands with you to welcome you. Since a number of people in the room
haven't met each other, there's a lot of random handshaking among others as well. If you
don't know the total number of handshakes, can you say with certainty that there are at
least two people present who shook hands with exactly the same number of people?

Solution:

Yes, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two people who shook hands with 
exactly the same number of people.

Explanation:
26 people total
Each person shakes hands with 1-25 others (minimum 1 because everyone greets the new person)
26 people (pigeons) but only 25 possible handshake counts (pigeonholes)
Since 26 > 25, at least two people must have the same handshake count

Pigeonhole Principle: If you have n+1 items and n containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.
Takeaway: Mathematical certainty doesn't require knowing specific details - just the constraints.
