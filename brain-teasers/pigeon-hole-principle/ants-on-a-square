Q:
There are 51 ants on a square with side length of 1. If you have a glass with a radius of
1/7, can you put your glass at a position on the square to guarantee that the glass
encompasses at least 3 ants

A: just uhmmmmm for at least 3, you'd need to divide it into 25 little squares, to allow 
at least 3 ants in one square, then the 1/7 radius can cover that little square yeah
