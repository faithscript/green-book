There are 5 bags with 100 coins in each bag. A coin can weigh 9 grams, 10 grams or 11
grams. Each bag contains coins of equal weight, but we do not know what type of coins
a bag contains. You have a digital scale (the kind that tells the exact weight). How many
times do you need to use the scale to determine which type of coin each bag contains?


Solution:
each back contributes to a total of n making 3^n combos
so one back spans [-1, 1], 3 combos
second should span total [-4, 4] for 9 combos, so should be [-3, 3], so 3 coins for second bag to satisfy the 9 combos

third should make total span [-13, 13] for 27 combos, so should be [-9, 9], so 9 coins for third back and so on, that distribution let's us deduce the distribution

subtract the distribution by the mean distribution using 10
