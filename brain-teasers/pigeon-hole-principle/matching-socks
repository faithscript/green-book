Q:
Your drawer contains 2 red socks, 20 yellow socks and 31 blue socks. Being a busy and
absent-minded MIT student, you just randomly grab a number of socks out of the draw
and try to find a matching pair. Assume each sock has equal probability of being
selected, what is the minimum number of socks you need to grab in order to guarantee a
pair of socks of the same color?

Solution:

By the pigeonhole principle, if there are 3 colors, you can pick 3 socks (one of each color) and still not have a matching pair. 
However, if you pick a 4th sock, it must match one of the colors you already have. 
Therefore, the minimum number of socks you need to grab to guarantee a matching pair is 4.
