Q: 
You and your colleagues know that your boss A's birthday is one of the following 10 dates:
Mar 4, Mar 5, Mar 8
Jun 4, Jun 7
Sep 1, Sep 5
Dec 1, Dec 2, Dec 8
A told you only the month of his birthday, and told your colleague C only the day. After
that, you first said: "I don't know A's birthday; C doesn't know it either." After hearing what you said, C replied: 
"I didn't know A's birthday, but now I know it." You smiled
and said: "Now I know it, too." After looking at the 10 dates and hearing your comments,
your administrative assistant wrote down A's birthday without asking any questions. So
what did the assistant write?

Thoughts: 
A is SURE that it doesn't know, and it's SURE that C doesn't know. C would know the day if it's unique, A knows that, and will be SURE, if the months that are
wrong have unique days.
2 and 7 are unique so take out the months that have it
We have:
Mar 4, Mar 5, Mar 8 
Sep 1, Sep 5

C has also reached this stage of realization, so for C to now know it, it will be a unique day in this subset, so
Mar 4, Mar 8 ,Sep 1

A is at this stage of realization, and for him to now know it, it will be a unique month in this subset, so
Sep 1

Ans: Sep 1
