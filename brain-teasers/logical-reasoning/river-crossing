Q: Four people, A, B, C and D need to get across a river. The only way to cross the river is
by an old bridge, which holds at most 2 people at a time. Being dark, they can't cross the
bridge without a torch, of which they only have one. So each pair can only walk at the
speed of the slower person. They need to get all of them across to the other side as
quickly as possible. A is the slowest and takes 10 minutes to cross; B takes 5 minutes; C
takes 2 minutes; and D takes 1 minute.
What is the minimum time to get all of them across to the other side?'

Thoughts:
total = 0 initially 

C and D should be the only ones picking people up with the torch light cuz of their short time
So they should both go across taking total += 2, D comes back with the light, total += 1
A and B leave D and total += 10, then C comes back to pick D and they go back together, total += 4

so two lowest distances take turn picking people up, and largest distances go together once and can't go back

Ans: 2+1+10+4 = 17
