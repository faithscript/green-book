Q: You have two ropes, each of which takes 1 hour to burn. But either rope has different
densities at different points, so there's no guarantee of consistency in the time it takes
different sections within the rope to burn. How do you use these two ropes to measure 45
minutes?

Thoughts:
lighting both ends takes 30 minutes, so light both ends of 1 rope to measure 30 minutes, while lighting one end of the other
after 30 minutes the other rope has 30 minutes left, so we can light the other end to make it add 15 minutes to the finished 30 minutes.
