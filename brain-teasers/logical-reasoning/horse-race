Q:
There are 25 horses, each of which runs at a constant speed that is different from the
other horses'.
. Since the track only has 5 lanes, each race can have at most 5 horses. If
you need to find the 3 fastest horses, what is the minimum number of races needed to
identify them?

Thoughts

5 races with 5 diff horses:
H H H H H 
H H H H H
H H H H H
H H H H H 
H H H H H


for the 3 fastest, we can find the 3 fastest in each group of 5, so after 5 races we have these contenders

H H H _ _
H H H _ _
H H H _ _
H H H _ _
H H H _ _  

now let's compare first place, if we run this race for the first place horses, we can eliminate even more, 

H H H _ _
H H _ _ _
H _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
Horse at the top left is definitely in top 3, then we check the other 5 to find out

Ans: 7 races
