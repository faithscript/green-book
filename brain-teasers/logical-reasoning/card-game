Q:
A casino offers a card game using a normal deck of 52 cards. The rule is that you turn
over two cards each time. For each pair, if both are black, they go to the dealer's pile; if
both are red, they go to your pile; if one black and one red, they are discarded. The
process is repeated until you two go through all 52 cards. If you have more cards in your
pile, you win $100; otherwise (including ties) you get nothing. The casino allows you to
negotiate the price you want to pay for the game. How much would you be willing to
pay to play this game?

Thoughts; 26 red, 26 black
If they're discarding cards, the red and black cards stay equal, so the cards left for you and the dealer stays the same, so don't play

Ans: Don't play
