Q:
Suppose that you are blind-folded in a room and are told that there are 1000 coins on the
floor. 980 of the coins have tails up and the other 20 coins have heads up. Can you
separate the coins into two piles so to guarantee both piles have equal number of heads?
Assume that you cannot tell a coins side by touching it, but you're allowed to turn over any number of coins\

Solution Summary:

Take any 20 coins at random and separate them from the rest (making two piles: 20 and 980 coins). Flip all 20 coins in the smaller pile. Now, both piles are guaranteed to have the same number of heads, regardless of the original arrangement.

Mathematical Explanation (Generalized):

Let n = number of heads among the total coins.
Take any n coins at random and separate them from the rest (making two piles: n and (total - n) coins).

Let m = number of heads in the n-coin pile (so there are n-m tails in this pile).
Since there are n heads in total, the (total - n)-coin pile has (n - m) heads.

After flipping all n coins in the small pile:
- The m heads become m tails.
- The (n - m) tails become (n - m) heads.

So, after flipping, the n-coin pile has exactly (n - m) heads.

Therefore:
- Number of heads in n-coin pile after flipping = (n - m)
- Number of heads in (total - n)-coin pile = (n - m)

Both piles have the same number of heads, regardless of the value of m.

This symmetry is guaranteed by the formula and the flipping operation.
